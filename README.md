# data mining 
 
This report presents the analysis and modelling of a dataset containing the
physiological responses of 186 healthy subjects. The dataset, "Dataset_Study2",
includes features extracted from ECG signals and aims to predict emotional states
based on these physiological responses. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate
the application of various data mining techniques to preprocess, analyse, and model the
dataset for accurate classification.
